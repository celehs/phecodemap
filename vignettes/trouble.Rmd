### Error: (converted from warning) package 'shiny' was build under R version ...

Error converted from warning prevents package install when dependency was built under newer R version.

Setting R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS="false" will cause warning messages during calls to install.packages() to become errors.

Try run the following code and re-install the package. 

```{r}
Sys.setenv("R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS" = "true")
```
