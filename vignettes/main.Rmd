## Overview

The phecodemap package builds a shiny app to visualize the hierarchy of 
PheCode Mapping with ICD-9 and ICD-10-cm. The same PheCode hierarchy is 
displayed in two ways: as a sunburst plot and as a tree.

There are 5 parts in the website: header, input table, legend, sunburst, tree plot.

### header

- About: The instructions of the app. 
- Help: The step-by-step introduction of the app.

The documentations of the `About` and `Help` are in inst/app/doc.

### Input table

First of all, click a row in the input table. You can also enter some items in the filtering bar for each column (phenotype, ICD description etc.) to spot on your targets. Once a row are selected, the app will automatically display the hierarchy with the selected phecode as root node in the sunburst and tree plot.
